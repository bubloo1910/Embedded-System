# Embedded-System

The gesture-controlled Robot arm [2][3] will function by a wearable hand glove from which the movements of the hand can be used as the input for the movement of the robot. The basic idea of our project is to develop a system (Robot) which can recognize the Human Interaction with it to accomplish the certain tasks assigned to it. In our project we will design a wearable Hand Glove which will contain the sensors (flex sensor) [1] mounted on it to capture the movement of the hand and convert the raw mechanical data into electrical form. This data will be further processed and converted into an understandable format for the Arduino Uno mounted on the Glove. Arduino UNO will deduce the commands and accordingly it will actuate the motor drivers to control the Motors [4] for various tasks on the robot.
